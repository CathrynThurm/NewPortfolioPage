            <h3>Hi! I'm Cathryn</h3>
            <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful. I am set to graduate in March of 2021. Studying in their engineering course I am learning a lot about software development.</p>
            <p> I can work alone or on a team. However, I like the unique challenges teams provide. I believe that teams push each other to make better more functional code. As well as help each other problem solve and create.</p>

            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>I love to create. I am an artist and a 3D printer fanatic. I love challenges and am constantly learning by taking courses. I've taken many classes on Udemy on different subjects, aiming to be a well-rounded programmer.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about web design because the internet has the unique ability to connect people from all different types of backgrounds. With the world changing rapidly its more important than ever for websites to be functional tools that <em>everyone</em> can use.</p>
